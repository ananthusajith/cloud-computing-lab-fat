<body><h1><u> My Favourite Sport- Swimming</u>
</h1>
<p> Swimming is my favourite sport. I enjoy it a lot. Swimming is a sport which almost everyone enjoys on a hot summer day, yet not many people know much about the details of competitive swimming. I shall give some information about the sport so as to help people understand the sport better. I have also inserted some useful links in this article for those seeking more information on the different strokes.

  <p><h3><u>
     Main Strokes  
  </u></h3></p>
  <ol>
    <li><b>Freestyle</b>- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freestyle_swimming"> Freestyle </a>is the fastest of all the four main strokes. A beginner typically is introduced to swimming through freestyle.<img class=pic1 src="http://www.active.com/Assets/Swimming/460x345/perfect-freestyle-460.jpg" width="200"/>  In freestyle, the swimmer lies flat on his stomach in the water. He does the flutter kick with his legs and moves his arms in a rotating motion simulataneously.  </li>

    <br></br>
    <li><b>Breaststroke</b>-This is considered by most people as the slowest stroke. In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaststroke"> breaststroke</a>, the swimmer does a frog like kick with his legs.<img class=pic1 src="http://www.teambath.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/PA-14178963.jpg" width=200/> Despite being slow, this is the most energy conservative stroke and is used during all open swimming events. </li>

    <li><b>Backstroke</b>- This is the most unique stroke of all as the swimmer swims while he lies on his back. <img class=pic1 src="https://instabeat-avatars-production.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/22143845/Backstroke.jpg" width=200/> The technique used in<a href="http://www.enjoy-swimming.com/backstroke.html"> backstroke</a> is similar to freestyle, except it is done on the back. I enjoy this stroke the most.</li><br></br>

    <li><b>Butterfly</b>- This is the most impressive stroke of all.In<a href="http://www.enjoy-swimming.com/butterfly-stroke.html"> butterfly</a> the legs make a dolphin like wave motion which propels the body forward at a very fast speed. <img class=pic1 src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/08/03/article-2183061-144C6750000005DC-424_964x525.jpg" width =200/> The arms make a circular motion while pulling out. This is universally recognised as the most tiring stroke as it forces the muscles of the core to work very hard.</li>

</ol>
<li><b>Individual Medley</b>- In a medley , the swimmer swims all four strokes one after the other. The stroke is changed at a regular interval of 25m,50m or 100m.

<h3><u>Typical sequence of a race</u></h3>
  <p>Though all strokes are unique in their technique, the broad structural elements of every race remains the same. The key sequences in every competitive race are:-<p>
  <ol><img class=pic1 src="https://www.swimmingworldmagazine.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/missy-franklin-relay-start-2.jpg" width=200>
    <li><b><u>Start- Dive</u></b></li>
    <ul><li>FREESTYLE- In freestyle, the swimmers start the race from a diving block, off which they dive into the pool. They dive into the pool with their hands entering first followed by the rest of the body.  Immediately after entering the water, the swimmer starts the dolphin kick in a streamlined position while he is underwater. This enables him to move forward fast. He continues the dolphin kick until the momentum from the dive dies out and then surfaces to start the freestyle motion.</li><br>
      <li>BREASTSTROKE- In breaststroke the swimmer enters in a dive like in freestyle. However dolphin kicks are not permitted. Instead the swimmer does an underwater breaststroke action without coming to the surface to breathe. This enables him to use the momentum of the dive to glide to a great distance.</li><img class=pic1 src="http://www.swimvortex.com/wp-content/uploads/elizabethpelton-800x600.jpg" width="200">
    <br>
      <li>BACKSTROKE- The start in backstroke is unique as the swimmer does not begin from the diving block but starts from within the pool itself. The swimmer holds onto the hand rails provided on the wall of the pool. Upon hearing the whistle he pulls himself up and pushes off from the wall in a backward arch. Then similar to frestyle he does a backward dolphin kick to utilise his momentum effectively.</li></br><br>
    <li>BUTTERFLY- The start for butterfly is the same as freestyle.</li></br></ul>
<li><b><u>Stroke</u></b>- This is unique for each and every stroke. Details of this have been given in the first section on 'types of strokes'.
    </li>
<li><b><u>Turn</u></b></li>
<ul><li>FREESTYLE-In freestyle the swimmer does a somersault underwater as he approaches the ending wall to turn. After the somersault, he pushes off from the wall with his legs and rotates onto his front as he emerges from the push.</li>
  <li> BREASTSTROKE- In this the swimmer must touch the wall with both his handsand doing a somersault is not permitted. He simply has to touch the wall and go.</li>
  <li>BACKSTROKE- In backstroke the swimmer counts his strokes from a distance indicator which he can see. When he approaches the wall he turns and does a somersault. Then he pushes off from the wall and starts the next lap.</li>
  <li>BUTTERFLY- Like breaststroke, the swimmer must touch the wall with both his hands after which he may just turn and push off.</li></ul>
<li><b><u>Finishing</u></b><ul>
      <li>FREESTYLE-The finish is relatively simple. The swimmer just has to touch the wall with one hand. The last stroke can be accompanied with a final dolphin kick for extra propulsion.</li>
      <li>BREASTSTROKE- This is the most complicated and technical finish. The swimmer must end the race by touching both his hands to the wall, or else he may be disqualified.</li>
      <li>BACKSTROKE- In this the swimmer must estimate his distance from the wall by counting his strokes from the distance marker flags. This requires practice and good estimation. </li>
      <li>BUTTERFLY- Similar to breaststroke, the swimmer must end the race by touching both his arms to the wall simultaneously.</li></ul>
